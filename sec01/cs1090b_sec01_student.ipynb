        "    \n",
        "The idea is to simulate multiple datasets by sampling our current one with replacement and fitting a model on this sample. The process is repeated multiple times until we have an *ensemble* of fitted models, all trained on slightly different datasets.\n",
        "    \n",
        "We can then treat the ensemble as a single 'bagged' model. When it is time to predict, each model in the ensemble makes its own predictions. These predictions can then be *aggregated* across models, for example, by taking the average or through majority voting.\n",
        "    \n",
        "We may also be interested in looking at the distribution of the predictions for a given observation as this may help us quantify our uncertainty in a way in which we could not with a single model's predictions (even if that model outputs a probability!)"
