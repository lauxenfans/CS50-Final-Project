# CS50-Final-Project
Documentation for your project in the form of a Markdown file called README.md. This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.

# WriteRight - README.md
WriteRight - A Whiteboard that Reverse Image Searches
Catherine Li, Louis Auxenfans, Sava Thurber

Hello there! Thank you so much for taking a look at our project. In this writeup, you will find all of the necessary compilation information and usage to get started with using WriteRight. This document should be comprehensive, however, in the case that you run into errors, please contact us via: cbli@college.harvard.edu, sthurber@college.harvard.edu, lauxenfans@college.harvard.edu.

Compilation
    Step 1: Download all our files from the zip folder to your VSCode 
    
    Step 2: Get the necessary libraries and programs downloaded and set up onto your computer.

        First, follow the CS50 video 'Flying the nest: https://youtu.be/vQd_fxzCIs0?si=J0lTphzZIoClXQcB' which will get your computer set up with Python and Flask. 
   
        Second, download the pip module in Python (if your computer doesn't have that already), so you can install the relevant python libraries.
        
        download the relevant Python libraries that we used in our project to make the website. You can install this by running pip install [library_name] in your terminal. 

        If that doesn't install the library, try running pip3 install [libray_name] or python -m pip install [library_name]
        Libraries Used:
        - Tkinter 
        - PIL
        - Flask_Session
        - werkzeug 
        - CS50

        Then, download the relevant Python libraries for our helper functions
        - pytz 
        - requests 
        - urllib3 
        - uuid 

    Step 3: Type flask run in your terminal so you can load the website and have fun playing around with the whiteboard!




Make a whiteboard for drawing and then reverse image search on google 

need to run by using "python -m flask run" as opposed to using flask run
